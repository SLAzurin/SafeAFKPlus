#Leave a command blank if you dont wish to use one, the commands are run during the process of setting the player to AFK
#this may cause issues if you attempt to teleport or move the player etc.
#The action command must either make the player no longer AFK or remove them from the server
Commands:
  Action: "kick [PLAYER] You were AFK for too long!"
  AFKStart: ""
  AFKStop: ""
  Warn: ""

#The server must have this many player before the action command will be run
#When the server hits this limit the players who have been AFK longer than the normal action time will be kicked
#Its also recommended that you edit the warning message to tell players that they will be kicked when the server reaches x players
#Setting to 0 means that players will always be acted upon when they reach their time to action
